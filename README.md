# IRB140_Robot_Forward-Backwards_Kinematics
Program to calculate the Forwards and Backwards Kinematics of the 6-DoF  IRB140 Articulated Robot. By calculating the Forward kinematics, we can know the pose of the robot given its actuators states. By calculation the Backwards Kinematics, we can know the state of its actuators given the position of the end effector.
